    <h1>Threat Hunting</h1>
    <h2>Why threat hunting is important.</h2>
    <p style="color:burlywood;">

      Threat hunting is important because sophisticated threats can get past automated cybersecurity. Although automated security tools and tier 1 and 2 security operations center (SOC) analysts should be able to deal with roughly 80% of threats, you still need to worry about the remaining 20%.<br> The remaining 20% of threats are more likely to include sophisticated threats that can cause significant damage. Given enough time and resources, they will break into any network and avoid detection for up to 280 days on average. Effective threat hunting helps reduce the time from intrusion to discovery, reducing the amount of damage done by attackers.<br>
      
      Attackers often lurk for weeks, or even months, before discovery. They wait patiently to siphon off data and uncover enough confidential information or credentials to unlock further access, setting the stage for a significant data breach. How much damage can potential threats cause?<br> According to the "Cost of a Data Breach Report," a data breach costs a company almost USD 4 million on average. And the harmful effects of a breach can linger for years. The longer the time between system failure and response deployed, the more it can cost an organization.<br>

    <h1>Penetration Testing</h1>
    <h2>What is penetration testing?</h2>
    <p style="color:yellowgreen;"></p>
     
        Penetration testing (or pen testing) is a security exercise where a cyber-security expert attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system.<br> The purpose of this simulated attack is to identify any weak spots in a system’s defenses which attackers could take advantage of.<br>

        This is like a bank hiring someone to dress as a burglar and try to break into their building and gain access to the vault.<br> If the ‘burglar’ succeeds and gets into the bank or the vault, the bank will gain valuable information on how they need to tighten their security measures.<br>

    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <h2>What is Blockchain Technology</h2>
    <p style="color:burlywood;">

      Blockchain is a method of recording information that makes it impossible or difficult for the system to be changed, hacked, or manipulated.<br> A blockchain is a distributed ledger that duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in the blockchain.<br>

      Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,”<br> in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.’<br>

      Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering.<br> Hence, the information the digital ledger contains is highly secure.<br>

      In simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network,<br> in which, the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases.<br> The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they can’t corrupt it.<br>

    <h1>Bug Bounty Hunting </h1>
    <h2>What is Bug Bounty</h2>
    <p style="color:burlywood;">

      Bug Bounty programs are a great way for companies to add a layer of protection to their online assets.<br> A bug bounty program is a crowdsourced penetration testing program that rewards for finding security bugs and ways to exploit them.<br>
 
      For researchers or cybersecurity professionals, it is a great way to test their skills on a variety of targets and get paid well in case they find some security vulnerabilities.<br> 

      The number of companies that have a formal crowdsourced program is increasing and so are the people who want to become freelance penetration testers.<br> The aspiring bug bounty hunters are of much different knowledge, experience, and skill levels.<br>

    <h2>Quantum Technology</h2>
    <p style="color:burlywood;">

    <b>What Is Quantum-Safe Cryptography, and Why Do We Need It?</b><br>

      Cryptography helps to provide security for many everyday tasks.<br> When you send an email, make an online purchase or make a withdrawal from an ATM.<br> cryptography helps keep your data private and authenticate your identity.<br>

      Today’s modern cryptographic algorithms derive their strength from the difficulty of solving certain math problems using classical computers or the difficulty of searching for the right secret key or message.<br> Quantum computers, however, work in a fundamentally different way.<br>Solving a problem that might take millions of years on a classical computer could take hours or minutes on a sufficiently large quantum computer,<br> which will have a significant impact on the encryption,<br> hashing and public key algorithms we use today. This is where quantum-safe cryptography comes in.<br>
